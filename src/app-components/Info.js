    Each position in the grid has a unit vector attached to it. 
    
    Empty grid cells aren't rendered in the editor, but for encoding purposes are treated as the Z vector (0,0,1).
    
    All other grid cells represent unit vectors in the XY plane.

    The alpha values depend on the editor mode:
    
    By default, empty pixels have a value of 0 (fully transparent) and all other pixels have a value of 255 (fully opaque).
    
    In normal map mode, alpha is always 255.
