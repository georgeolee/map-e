# map-e

A simple 2D vector map editor with a click-and-drag interface. It's a little tool I made to design particle emitter shapes for [my particle scratchpad](https://github.com/georgeolee/p-widge).

### File Format

Vector maps are exported as PNG textures, with the red and green channels of each pixel corresponding to the X and Y components of a unit vector at that point. It's similar to the technique used by [normal maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mapping), but in 2D.


### Try It Out

You can find a working build (not necessarily the latest) [here](https://map-e.netlify.app).\
