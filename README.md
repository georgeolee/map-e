# map-e

A simple editor for creating vector maps that can be used by shaders or other programs that take texture data as an input.

It's a tool I made to design emitter shapes for my [particle scratchpad](https://github.com/georgeolee/p-widge).

### Encoding

Vector maps are exported as PNG textures. The red and green channels of each pixel map to the X and Y components of a unit vector at that point â€“ similar to the technique used by [normal maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mapping), but in 2D. Empty points are represented with transparent pixels.
